Visit the Coffeeshop
====================

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/mrap/coffeeshop.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/mrap/coffeeshop)

Currently, the project is live [here](http://doingnow.herokuapp.com/).

Doing work alone sucks.  It's much more enjoyable when there are other productive people are around.

Kind of like working at a coffeeshop?  *Exactly* like working in a coffeeshop. (Without the public wifi or the coffee itself.)
